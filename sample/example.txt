# Sample File for Testing

This is a sample file to test the extraction functionality.

## Example Content

Here are some "quoted strings" that the sample extractor will find:

- "Hello, World!"
- 'Single quotes work too'
- "Another example string"

The sample extractor uses a simple regex to find quoted strings.
Replace this with your actual test data once you customize the template.

## Testing Instructions

1. Open this file in VS Code
2. Run the "Extract Items" command (Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+E)
3. View the results in a new document

## Next Steps

- Replace the extraction logic in `src/extraction/extract.ts`
- Add your own format-specific extractors in `src/extraction/formats/`
- Update this sample file with relevant test data
